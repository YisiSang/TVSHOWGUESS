# Human Annotation #

We randomly selected a total of 300 samples from _Friends_ and _The Big Bang Theory_. The __friends.tsv__ and __tbbt.tsv__ include our annotation results. The __friends.raw__ and __tbbt.raw__ are the selected dialogues/conversations from where those samples come.

```bash
python annotation_analysis.py
```
The command above prints the stats of the annotations.
