A half-human, half-hippo soldier would be pretty badass. P1 : Yes, but when they're hungry-hungry, you can stop them with marbles. P0 : Yeah, the correct animal for interspecies supersolider is koala. You would wind up with an army so cute it couldn't be attacked. P2 : But half-man, half-owl could fly... P0 : The answer is cuddly soldiers with big flat noses.

When? P5 : I said I'll get to it. P0 : I'm sensing awkwardness, am I right? P3 : Yes. P0 : Swish. bernadette : I don't want to be pushy, but you've never done pharmaceutical sales before. It seems like you could use this time to get a head start. P5 : Well, the first few weeks will be all training. They'll tell me everything I need to know. bernadette : But imagine how impressed they'd be if you showed up already familiar with the material. P5 : Okay, so what, you want me to be like a teacher's pet? bernadette : Couldn't hurt. P4 : Mm, I don't know.

Am I wrong? P1 : No, I just, I feel kind of uncomfortable talking about her like this. Usually when someone's being talked about behind their back, it's me and it's right in front of my face. P0 : I'm sorry. I just need a little break from her. P1 : I understand.

They're allowing me to move on from string theory, but they made me a junior professor and are requiring me to teach a class. P0 : I don't understand.

Apparently, I have a reputation for being obnoxious. P0 : What? P3 : Hey, Sheldon, I'm sorry. P1 : No, it's fine. Now I can devote all my time to dark matter. P3 : Aw, you brought cookies for everyone? P1 : Oh, yes. Fig Newtons. I was going to ask them which scientist both helped to develop calculus and had a famous cookie named after him? And then after someone said Newton, I was going to tell them they're wrong. The cookies are named after a town in Massachusetts. And then I'd throw the cookies away. P2 : Hey, what if I took your class? P1 : Why would you do that? P0 : Yeah, why would you do that? P3 : What's wrong with you? P2 : I'm thinking about getting my doctorate, and he wants to teach.

I don't think you'd understand a single thing I was talking about. P3 : Ask why not again, I've got an answer. P2 : Sheldon, I'm more than smart enough to take your class. P1 : No. P2 : Yes. P1 : How would you determine the ground state of a quantum system with no exact solution? P2 : I would guess a wave-function and then vary its parameters until I found the lowest energy solution. P1 : Hmm. Do you know how to integrate X squared times E to the minus X, without looking it up? P2 : I'd use Feynman's trick, differentiate under the integral sign. P1 : Okay. Um, what is the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics? P2 : Since every interpretation gives exactly the same answer to every measurement, they are all equally correct. However, I know you believe in the Many Worlds Interpretation, so I'll say that. Now do you think I'm smart enough? P1 : No. P2 : Oh, come on.

I think the idea that someone could be as smart as you, or even smarter, scares the pants off you, and you can't deal with it. P1 : Interesting point. You're suggesting that I have emotional issues below my consciousness which drive my behaviour, thus causing me to lash out at anything or anyone that threatens my intellectual superiority. P0 : Might be something to think about. P1 : Leonard? P0 : Yeah. P1 : Howard's allergic to peanuts.

Maybe we can come up with a punishment for straying off topic. P2 : Not getting to see who wins at pigeon ping-pong comes to mind. P3 : We could snap a rubber band on our wrists every time we get sidetracked. P1 : Mmm, not bad. You know, in medieval times, idle chatter was punished with a device called the scold's bridle.

Negative reinforcement is the removal of a positive stimulus. It's a common mistake. P3 : Negative reinforcement is really wrong? P2 : Oh, it's used incorrectly all the time.

What do you want? P0 : So, I did a little research on what the conditions are like in the mines, and the guys might be right, sounds pretty rough down there. For starters, it's very humid, and about a hundred degrees. P1 : Well, I'm from Texas and you're from India, we're no strangers to the fragrant armpit.
